# Bogus Idle Game
After recently rediscovering the fantastic [Universal Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/), I decided to try to code up my own little idle game to get some practice with vanilla javascript.

Things are currently in a 'messy-but-working' state that I'll endeavor to clean up once I add a bit more functionality.
